# PrinterConfig-Hevo

This is the repository for the configuration files used with Umikaze image for 
the Thing-Printer Replicape.  The configuration files I have chosen to backup so far
are
1. The Redeem local configuration
2. OctoPrint Default Printer configuration
3. OctoPrint configuration file

Note that the most recent configuration file will be in the printer branch.  That's where
the printer automatically commits files that have been changed.

## Printer
The printer is a Hypercube Evolution (CoreXY) based on the 300x300x300 settings in the configuration
workbook.  My print area is somewhat smaller than that.  It currently homes to the back right
with the print bed lowered to the bottom.

## Capturing the changes
